# Preface

In preparing this book, I have had to choose whether to primarily address musicians or engineers. I reasoned that the prioritization of one would come at the expense of the understanding of the other. I considered splitting the book into two sections, or even two installments, addressing each topic twice, once from each perspective. 

Ultimatley, I feel it is better to organize the chapters by topic, and not shy away from presenting the unfamiliar aspects of each. Therefore, something in these pages will probably be difficult for you. When you encounter these things, I encourage you to skim or even skip them. One theme of this book is that music in an emergent phenomenon that's dependent on the interaction of subsystems, each of which can be understood independently. Grokking the totality isn't necessary for fruitful investigation of the parts. So, I encourage you to plow ahead according to your curiosity, and return to the things that are most difficult as your interest compells you.

Music is a complex topic. My goal is to simplify it. At first, things might be overwhelming, because by simplifying we will come away with many more things than we started with. However, this feeling is incorrect because simplicity and cardinality are independent from each other. Simplicity is the opposite of complexity

- Will not assume advanced knowledge of technical subjects such as physics, biology, mathematics, music theory, or history. 
- Will use standard technical notation when appropriate without providing an in depth description of the system of notation.
